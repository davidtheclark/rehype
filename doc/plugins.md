## List of Utilities

See [**hast**][hast-util] for a list of utilities for working with the syntax
tree.  See [`unist`][unist-util] for other utilities which work with **hast**
nodes, too.

And finally, see [**vfile**][vfile-util] for a list of utilities for working
with virtual files.

## Using plugins

To use a plug-in programmatically, invoke the [`use()`][unified-use]
function.

To use plug-in with `rehype-cli`, pass [a `--use`][use] flag or specify
it in a [configuration file][rcfile].

## Creating plugins

First, read up on the [concept of plug-ins][unified-plugins].  Then, read the
[guide on “Creating a plugin with unified”][guide].  Finally, take one of
existing [plug-ins][plugins], which looks similar to what you’re about to do,
and work from there.  If you get stuck, [issues][] and [Gitter][] are good
places to get help.

You should pick a name prefixed by `'rehype-'`, such as `rehype-lint`.

Note that, if the thing you create cannot be given to `rehype().use()`,
it isn’t a “plug-in”.  Don’t use the `rehype-` prefix as that could
confuse users.  If it works with the HAST tree, use `'hast-util-'`, if
it works with any Unist tree, use `unist-util-`, if it works with virtual
files, use `vfile-`.
